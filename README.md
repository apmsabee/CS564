CS564 - Database Design final project. 

Course taken summer 2023.

Our app is a python-based app used to interact with data related to the IPL Cricket League. 
Based on filters selected by the user, our app queries our database and displays a variety of data,
filtered for either match-, team-, or player-specific metrics. 

There is a project report and demo video
included for further illustration.
