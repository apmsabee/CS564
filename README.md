Our app is a python-based app used to interact with data related to the IPL Cricket League. \n
Based on filters selected by the user, our app queries our database and displays a variety of data,\n
filtered for either match-, team-, or player-specific metrics. There is a project report and demo video\n
included for further illustration.
